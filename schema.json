INSURANCES        Fully Diluted EPS:    Bottom-line EPS. Includes the effects of all one-time and extraordinary gains/losses. Number of Shares Diluted is used for calculation of EPS, calculated as if all potentially diluted securities had been changed into shares of common stock.  For example, options and warrants will have a dilutive effect on EPS if the average market price of the stock exceeds the issuance price.  These are considered in-the-money options and warrants (Treasury Stock Method).  The If-Converted Method is used to determine the potential dilution of convertible securities.

Early extinguishment of debt is only considered XO until the end of 2001.    Includes the effects of other one-time gains/losses.    Uses weighted average shares figured as if all the company's convertible securities had been changed into shares of common stock.    When Income from XO minus Minority Interest is negative, diluted shares are not used to calculate Diluted EPS before XO because the result is anti-dilutive.  Instead, Diluted EPS is the same as Basic.    When Income before Extraordinary Items minus Minority Interest is positive, Diluted EPS before XO is valid even if anti-dilutive.    If not disclosed by company, Diluted EPS before XO is same as Basic for US and Canada, blank for rest of world.    If company states there is no significant dilution, assumption is that Diluted EPS before XO is same as Basic.
